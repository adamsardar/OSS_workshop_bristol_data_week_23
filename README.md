## LV=GI Workshop on Open Source Software

### Abstract

The open-source community is a marvel of working in tech. Many, if not all, of the fantastic tools that data scientists use
day-to-day are built in full visibility of anyone online, with a collaboration model that is truly open to all. Contributors
come from across both for-profit and non-commercial organisations, with almost every sector represented. I'd like to give you
an overview of what this means for groups working in data.

In this workshop, I'm going to speak to several underappreciated features of the open-source ecosystem that should be of interest
to anyone in the data community. Namely that you can: see how other, remote, high-performing data practitioners operate; upskill
and learn how to communicate effectively with other tech workers; and how to improve the standards at which you operate in your
own projects. All from the comfort of your own laptop! I'll progress through a workshop example of making contributions (not just code!)
to open source projects, using a GitHub repo seeded by LV as a case study.

### Level of expertise

Beginner and intermediates will get the most out of this session. Experts could still learn a few things though!

### Learning Outcomes

Understand the benefits of following and engaging with open-source communities.

### About me

I have been building computational, statistics-backed products for well over a decade. With a background covering academia, biotech and now 
insurtech, I am convinced that our disciplines have more similarities than differences across data-centric roles. I'm interested to see how 
our sector grows whilst also remaining mindful that we need to actively drive it forwards to prevent stagnation. We are the first people in
history to be creating the sorts of tools that we build; this should be a well-spring of motivation for us all.
